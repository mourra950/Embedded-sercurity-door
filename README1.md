I want to share with you my fourth and final project in Embedded systems in diploma number 64 with Mohamed Tarek .
In this project I implement a system to be a security door.
there was objectives in this project to be completed :
1-instead of using only ready to use libraries , I had to make my own and make it configurable without the need to change anything in the headers file and configure also old files.
2-the use of 2 atmega16 and establish a serial port to send and receive data from each other.
3-Creating the drivers to alarm the user when he insert the wrong password 3 times in a row.
4- Creating the drivers of the motor to open and close and stop depending on the state and the user inputs
5-Create Timer0 drivers.
6-memory to store or retrieve the password
this project being wholesome and making me study the diploma all over again from C to embedded and interrupts and timers to gpios and how the I2C works and finishing it was another whole achievement for me and I am glad that I went through it.
will be putting code link here soon.
